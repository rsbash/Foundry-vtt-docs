# Foundry-VTT-Docs

I am keeping these notes not to reinvent the wheel, but to succinctly document common workflows I need as a GM in Foundry. I am also using this as an exercise in technical writing. 

These instructions are general to Foundry, unless specifically mentioning modules from Starfinder or Cyberpunk RED. 

This repo is WIP.
