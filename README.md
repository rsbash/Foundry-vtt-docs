# Foundry-VTT-Docs

I am keeping these notes not to reinvent the wheel, but to succinctly document common workflows I need as a GM in Foundry. I am also using this as an exercise in technical writing. 

These instructions are general to Foundry, unless specifically mentioning modules from Starfinder or Cyberpunk RED. 

Please feel free to clone this repo, link to it, or otherwise to use it as it proves useful to you. I would appreciate attribution where possible, but ultimately I am just glad if you read this and it helps you.
