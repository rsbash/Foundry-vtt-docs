Game systems contain compendiums and various useful scripts and sheets to build a game around a specific ruleset. These systems receive periodic updates, and Foundry will alert administrator users via the UI in the Settings tab. 

Click the settings tab to see information about the new game's version, and to view any patch notes the game system maker attached.
