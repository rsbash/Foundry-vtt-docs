# Create a World

After installing a game system, create a world to host the system, players, and assets needed to run the game. 


## Creating Worlds

World creation involves naming a world, providing the data path users will need to access the world, assigning a game system to it, and providing any important descriptors (such as a background image or campaign description). Additionally, it is possible to configure the date of the world's next session. 

To create worlds:

1. From the Foundry VTT splash screen, click **Create World**. 
2. Enter a **World Title** to name your Game World. 
3. Provide a hyphenated **Data Path**. Usually, a data path is the hyphenated name of the world. 
4. From the **Game System** dropdown menu, select a game system. 
5. From the **Background Image** field, upload an optional background image. 
6. In the **Next Session** field, enter an optional date for the world's next session. 
7. In the **World Description** field, enter a description of the game system. Good descriptions might include campaign details, an ["elevator pitch"](https://careerdevelopment.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf1041/files/media/elevator_pitch.pdf) of the game's main ideas, and/or lists of characters and important details.
