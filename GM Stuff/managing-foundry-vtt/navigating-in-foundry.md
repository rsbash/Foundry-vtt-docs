Foundry's main menu consists of several tabs, each containing options including:
* Game world creation.
* System installations.
* Administrative options

## Game Worlds
This panel is the default displayed when Foundry first loads, it contains all of the game worlds you have created to run games in. When Foundry is first launched this list will be empty (as pictured to the right) but will quickly become populated with campaigns for you and your players to adventure in.

## Game Systems
This panel lists all of the currently installed game systems. Update them to their most current versions if required, search for new systems, or un/install game systems. Game systems are vital for the creation of game worlds and running game sessions.

## Add-on Modules
This panel lists all of the modules that are currently installed and available to be used in a game world. This panel also allows you to update modules to their most current version if required. Modules do nothing on their own and must be loaded from within a live game. 

## Configuration
This panel lists various configuration settings that you can use to fine-tune the behavior of Foundry.

> When you first launch Foundry Virtual Tabletop, it's recommended that you navigate to the Configuration tab and set an Administrator Password. This password is encrypted and allows you to secure Foundry VTT to prevent access to the main setup menu. It's also required to use the Return to Setup feature from the login page of any currently hosted world.

## Updating the Software
This panel allows you to see the current version of Foundry and if a newer version is available. You can update your version of foundry from this menu, and even switch to various test branches, provided that one is currently available.
