Actor sheets are the name given to "character sheets", and typically take whatever format the game system recommends and uses. These sheets usually have several tabs with lots of clickable elements and fields to enter data. This page is designed to help walk players through generally how an Actor sheet works, what it does, and how to use it when playing games on Foundry VTT. 

> Example
>
> Mary is rolling a new Starfinder character. Her character sheet lists her character's attributes and modifiers. Starfinder's rules state Mary's character begins with a base state of 10 on every attribute. Mary first adds her species, class, and theme to her character sheet from the compendium tab. Next, Mary applies all remaining points she is using to "purchase" attribute stats.

## Accessing Your Actor Sheet


## Adding Attributes, Themes, and More to Characters

When you give yourself something, like a class attribute, feat, item or theme, take it from the "Compendium" tab. This tab holds all the necessary values by the book and takes care of the calculations we need for things like damage and attributes on its own. 

To drag something from the compendium tab:

1. Open your character sheet and navigate to the "features" or "inventory" tab. Features for character creation stuff, inventory for equipment.
2. In the right-side drawer, click the "Compendium" tab.
3. Locate the compendium that holds the item you want (maybe a theme, species, class, or other equipment). 
4. Drag the item into your character sheet.

### Manual Attribute Entry

Generally, Foundry character sheets include some space for attribute scores. There may also be check boxes or lists for feats/skills/etc. When creating a character, only enter the base values into the attribute section.
